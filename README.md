# Palindrome Checker
*This repository contains a simple Palindrome Checker application that determines whether a given string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequences of characters that reads the same forward and backward, ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization.* :blush:

## Features ðŸŒŸ:
1. **Palindrome Validation:** The application checks whether the input string is a palindrome, ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization.

2. **Real-time Feedback:** As you enter text, the application provides instant feedback on whether the input is a palindrome.

3. **Clear Input Button:** A button to clear the input field and start a new check.

4. **User-friendly Interface:** Simple and clean design for ease of use.

## Technologies Used :v:

1. **HTML5:** For the structure of the web application.

2. **CSS3:** For styling and layout, ensuring the application is visually appealing.

3. **JavaScript:** For the core logic to check if a string is a palindrome and provide real-time feedback.
